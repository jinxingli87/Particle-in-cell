# Particle-in-cell simulation of banded chorus waves and the visualization code
This is 1-D Darwin particle-in-cell simulation code that demonstrates the generation of banded chorus waves. The detailed information of the parameter setting is described in This paper: Li et al. (2019), Origin of two-band chorus in the radiation belt of Earth, Nature Communications, 10, 4672, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12561-3

The PIC code is written in C++ and Fortran. The visualization code is written in Python 3.
